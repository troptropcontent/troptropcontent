### Hello ðŸ˜„

After a master degree in accounting and 3 years of professional experience in the field I decided to start a new carreer in full stack development. I attended the Full Stack development BootCamp of [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon) in last January and I've been coding all day everyday since then. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Ptite? 

A simple app to organize diners and meetups with friends with a few clicks (when, who, where => invites sent to concerned peoples)

The goal was to develop my skills on **React** and the **Single Page Applications**. To do so I chose to split the application in two : 

* **[The back-end](https://github.com/troptropcontent/ptite-api)** : A Ruby On Rails API wich exposes all the JSON requested by the Front End

* **[The front-end](https://github.com/troptropcontent/ptite-front-react)** : A React App wich consumes the JSON exposed by the back end API

The communication between the two apps is authentified by **Json Web Tokens** (generated thanks to **[jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt)**) exchanges in order for both apps to know who's connected. 
I used [bcrypt](https://github.com/bcrypt-ruby/bcrypt-ruby) to keep the users password secure.

## What I worked on:

* **[open-quiver](https://open-quiver.herokuapp.com/)** and **[yummifood](https://www.yummifood.net/)** : the two first websites I created during the training at Le Wagon with my classmates. (repos GitHub : **[open-quiver](https://github.com/troptropcontent/open-quiver)** , **[yummifood](https://github.com/troptropcontent/yummi)**);

* **[QuizzTom](https://quizztom.herokuapp.com/)** : a Quizz App I created to keep practicing.( repos GitHub: **[QuizzTom](https://github.com/troptropcontent/QuizzTom)**)

* **[LaLogomotive](http://lalogomotive.com/)** : I create Logos on my free time for different kind of project.
